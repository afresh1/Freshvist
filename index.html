    <p>
    This app is a work in progress, see the support site for a roadmap, but
    I need people bugging me about finishing it and adding features. It has
    been going very slowly without feedback. 
    If you have suggestions or comments, please let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am planning to make this support some sort of cached mode where it 
    keeps a copy of your lists on-device and syncs changes with the server 
    when it can, however that is a more difficult problem to solve so it is a
    fair ways down on the list.
    </p>

    I could really use some help from a graphics guru who can help 
    improve the look and feel of the app and make a better looking icon.

    Now click this preferences button and log into your Checkvist account.
