This is a webOS app to give access to Checkvist lists on-the-go.

Eventually that means offline support, but that is further down the roadmap.

This app is written with the HP Enyo javascript framework, but once
it reaches a 1.0 milestone it will get a fat Mojo version as well.


Patches must be contributed with a compatible license.

Current work is organizing the code and then moving towards a 0.5 release.
